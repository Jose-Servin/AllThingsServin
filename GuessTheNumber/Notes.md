# Guess my Number Game

## Game Summary

User will submit a number to guess and will get a message if it's too low or too high. If the secret number is not guessed, the score will decrease by 1. This becomes the user's "score." Once the number is guessed, the user gets a "Congratulations" message and their score becomes the high score until they do better. To play again, there's an "Again" button which will reset everything except the high score.
